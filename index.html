        <h3>About Me:</h3>

        <p class="bigger_font p">
          I believe in the power of my Beliefs, and I bring that perspective
          into every project I undertake. An aspiring graphic designer and
          photographer with a passion for learning. Currently delving into UX/UI
          design and programming, I aim to blend creativity with functionality.
          Outside the digital realm, I thrive on hiking adventures, camping
          trips, and the simple joy of reading books in the metro. Film and
          music are my constant companions, providing inspiration for my
          creative pursuits. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities
          of design and life together. Feel free to see my artworks.
